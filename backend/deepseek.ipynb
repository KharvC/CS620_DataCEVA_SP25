      "Okay, so I need to figure out how many rows are in the liquorsales table based on the provided schema and the sample data. Let me break this down step by step.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, looking at the table schema, it's clear that the table has several columns with specific data types. The primary concern here is determining the number of rows, which I assume means counting the number of records in the table or querying for a specific row like INV-331960...\n",
      "\n",
      "The user provided some sample data, but from just the schema and data given, it seems that each line represents an invoice entry. So, essentially, each line is a distinct record in the table.\n",
      "\n",
      "To answer how many rows there are, I should write a SQL query that selects the COUNT of the invoices. COUNT is a common aggregation function used to determine the total number of records in a table.\n",
      "\n",
      "I need to make sure that the columns used for counting have the correct data types and that they don't contain any null values or other anomalies. Looking at the schema, all the necessary columns (like invoice_line_no, date, store, name, address, etc.) are present, so I can use them without issues.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, the SQL query will select the COUNT of invoice_line_no from the liquorsales table. This should return the total number of rows in the table, which corresponds to the number of sales records.\n",
      "\n",
      "I don't think there's any need for additional joins or subqueries here since the question is straightforward: just counting how many entries are in the table. Therefore, using COUNT on invoice_line_no should suffice.\n",
