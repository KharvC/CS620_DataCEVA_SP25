Back to the Future: Just Ask AI

Project Overview

Back to the Future: Just Ask AI is a cutting-edge project that enhances data-driven decision-making using Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG). By integrating a Large Language Model (LLM) with a dynamic retrieval mechanism, this tool allows users to generate insights from a dataset simply by asking questions. Instead of relying solely on static dashboards, users can interact with an AI-powered assistant to obtain real-time, contextual insights.

This project involves setting up a database, leveraging powerful LLMs, developing custom logic for data retrieval, and building an intuitive front-end to facilitate seamless user interaction. The goal is to bridge the gap between raw data and actionable intelligence, empowering businesses with smarter, data-driven decision-making.
